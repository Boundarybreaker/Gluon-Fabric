Aquarius adds even more content and additions to the Update Aquatic. Currently planned

- Flippers - give you Dolphin's Grace while equipped, letting you swim faster.

- Channeling II and III - Channeling 2 lets you strike entities with lightning when it's raining or thunderstorming, and Channeling 3 lets you strike entities any time.
